# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AI Email Assistant application to protect user data and ensure secure operation.

## Credential Security

### Email Credentials

The application uses a multi-layered approach to protect email credentials:

1. **Encryption**
   - Credentials are encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
   - Key derivation uses both PBKDF2 and Scrypt for enhanced security
   - PBKDF2 uses 600,000 iterations with SHA-256
   - 32-byte cryptographically secure salt
   - Automatic key rotation every 30 days

2. **Storage**
   - Encrypted credentials stored in user-specific directory
   - Filenames are SHA-256 hashes of email addresses
   - Metadata stored separately from sensitive data
   - Version tracking for credential format

3. **Access Control**
   - System keyring used for master key storage
   - Secure memory handling for sensitive operations
   - Automatic session timeouts
   - Rate limiting on credential access

### API Keys

API keys are protected using dedicated security measures:

1. **Encryption**
   - Separate encryption keys for API credentials
   - Fernet-based symmetric encryption
   - Regular key rotation
   - Secure key derivation with PBKDF2

2. **Access Control**
   - Rate limiting (100 requests per 5-minute window)
   - Access logging with timestamps
   - Separate keyring namespace for API keys
   - Automatic key rotation

## OAuth Security

1. **Implementation**
   - Standard OAuth 2.0 flow
   - Secure token storage
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Token expiration handling

2. **Provider-Specific**
   - Gmail: OAuth 2.0 with email verification
   - Outlook: Modern authentication support
   - Yahoo: OAuth implementation
   - Custom providers: Configurable security settings

## Data Protection

1. **At Rest**
   - Encrypted storage for all sensitive data
   - Secure credential storage using system keyring
   - Encrypted email cache (optional)
   - Secure attachment handling

2. **In Transit**
   - TLS/SSL for all network connections
   - Certificate validation
   - Secure IMAP/SMTP connections
   - API communication encryption

## Audit & Logging

1. **Security Audit**
   - Access logging for sensitive operations
   - API usage tracking
   - Authentication attempts logging
   - Configuration changes tracking

2. **Log Security**
   - Secure log storage
   - Log rotation
   - Sensitive data masking in logs
   - Configurable retention period

## Session Management

1. **Features**
   - Configurable session timeouts
   - Automatic logout on inactivity
   - Secure session storage
   - Session isolation

2. **Authentication**
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Failed attempt limiting
   - Account lockout protection
   - Password policy enforcement

## Best Practices

1. **Development**
   - Regular security updates
   - Dependency scanning
   - Code security reviews
   - Automated security testing

2. **Deployment**
   - Secure configuration guidelines
   - Environment separation
   - Backup procedures
   - Update management

## Security Recommendations

1. **User Configuration**

   - Use app-specific passwords
   - Regular password rotation
   - Enable encryption features

2. **System Requirements**
   - Updated operating system
   - Secure keyring system
   - Antivirus protection
   - Firewall configuration

## Incident Response

1. **Reporting**
   - Security issue reporting procedure
   - Vulnerability disclosure policy
   - Contact information
   - Response timeline

2. **Handling**
   - Incident response plan
   - Data breach procedure
   - User notification process
   - Recovery steps

## Compliance

1. **Standards**
   - GDPR compliance measures
   - Data protection regulations
   - Privacy policy
   - Terms of service

2. **Certifications**
   - Security certifications
   - Compliance audits
   - Regular assessments
   - Documentation maintenance

## Security Updates

1. **Process**
   - Regular security patches
   - Automated updates
   - Dependency updates
   - Security advisories

2. **Verification**
   - Update signature verification
   - Integrity checking
   - Rollback procedures
   - Testing protocol
